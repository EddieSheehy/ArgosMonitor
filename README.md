# ArgosMonitor

This project was a simple script which used Heroku to run the script 24/7. It would constantly check the Argos website to see if PS5's or Xbox One's were reservable or not and posting the result to Discord Webhook.


## How to run
```bash
python3 Argos.py
```

## Example of Discord Webhook
